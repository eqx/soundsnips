Besides being one of the extremely few venues designed by composers (in this case, Richard Wagner), its interior was crafted to only celebrate Wagner's work and none by any other. The reverberation time is very long, meaning the music echoes and vibrates throughout the hall – an acoustic element crucial for Wagner's operas. The orchestra pit is located under the stage and covered with a hood so the audience would focus on the performers on stage rather than those with an instrument. This technique lessens the brassy quality that many of Wagner's works sometimes attain in other venues and also prevents the singers from being overpowered by the composer's rather bombastic style. Wagner created this venue primarily for the annual Bayreuth Festival, which further celebrates his repertoire with five weeks of performances and special events. The festival is organized by direct descendants of the main man himself.","fun_fact" : "Igor Stravinsky once remarked the Festspielhaus looked like \"a crematorium and a very old-fashioned one at that.\"","first_performance" : "Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen on Aug. 13, 1876","website" : "http://www.bayreuther-festspiele.de/english/english_156.html","youtube_account" : "","videos":["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY8zGYe5W5g","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHUpBYnwOA","http://youtu.be/3oe07l0B4cc","http://youtu.be/xeAFBfORpmE"],"photos":[{"flickr_id":7422796826,"title" : "A view of the Festspielhaus Bayreuth around the year 1900.","attribution" : "United States Library of Congress","source" : "Wikimedia Commons","license" : "Public Domain"},

The removal of a hanging curtain and the placement of a concrete slab during its 1986 renovation are said to have severely altered the sound. Its owners removed the concrete in 1995 even though some experts contend the slab was there at least since 1962 and the real problem is the curtain's absence.

Even the performances presented vary wildly - from brand new productions based on current events, to overwhelming and ornate presentations of classic opera, to centuries-old Japanese forms of entertainment such as Kabuki and Bunraku. But just because the theater paints with broad strokes doesn't mean the quality is stretched - this venue offers world-class entertainment with an acoustic quality that is consistently rated extremely high by composers, performers and audience members alike.

It took ten years to restore the opera house to its former glory with a few modern upgrades. The auditorium is a sleek, modern horseshoe that features little interior ornamentation, while the neo-Renaissance facade is very close to what it looked like when it first opened in 1869: embellished to the nth degree with every kind of classic allegory. There, the statues and bronze sculptures represent muses or themes of the arts.

An apparition of a woman is said to have haunted the building throughout the 20th century. They say she's the ghost of an actress who committed suicide, but no one's sure of any concrete details other than her name: \"Elvira.\" Employees of the theater say she moves among audience, putting the spring-loaded seats in a permanent \"down\" position when no one is sitting in them. They say she's a magnificent sight to see if you can catch her - a thin, shimmering, flowing woman with long hair so blonde it looks translucent (and it probably is, her being a ghost and all). But even if you don't see her, you'll probably hear her. At performances, casts have said they could hear her disapproving sighs if it's not going so well. Don't believe us?
